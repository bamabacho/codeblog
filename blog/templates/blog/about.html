	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Bobby Gulshan. I am developer based in Washington, DC.</p>
	<p>I fell into technology a few years back and completely love it. I love being able to build useful, and sometimes elegant and beautiful things with simple tools. I love seeing a problem and breaking it down into it's constituent parts in search of a solution.</p>
	<p>As a freelancer, I have mostly worked in Wordpress and some in Drupal. This blog is built using Django, a framework I plan on using more and more. I am working towards adding Javascript frameworks to my arsenal, specifically Angular.</p>
	<p>In addition, I am studying both Machine Learning and Cybersecurity in my spare time. I'm also a writer of both fiction and non-fiction, and try to make music when I can.</p>
	<p>Let's work on something together . . .</p>
